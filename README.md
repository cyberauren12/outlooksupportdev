# front-end-microsoft-landing-page-clone
In this project I builded my own version of the Microsoft homepage using HTML5/CSS and a bit of JS for the menu. I got to practice modern CSS including CSS grid, flexbox and responsive media queries. Thanks to Traversy Media for a great tutorial. (https://www.traversymedia.com/)
